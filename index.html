		</div>
		<p>We are a team of students from the University of Waterloo, renowned as one of the top engineering schools in Canada, whose goal is to win the 2017 International Robotic Sailing Regatta. Our team consists of a variety of engineers including Mechatronics, Mechanical, Electrical, and Chemical engineers. Besides sailing, we are passionate about complex electronics, robotics systems, and mechanical design. As a team we are working together to build something truly innovative. As a student team we rely on sponsor help to work.</p>
